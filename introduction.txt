Basic introduction to packaging, reasons problems rationale

This section includes basic introduction to Java packaging world to people
coming from different backgrounds. Goal is to understand language of all groups
involved. If you are a Java developer coming into contact with RPM packaging for
the first time start reading xref:XFor_Devs[Java developer] section. On the
other hand if you are coming from RPM packaging background an
xref:XFor_Packagers[introduction to Java world] is probably a better starting
point.

It should be noted that especially in this section we might sacrifice
correctness for simplicity
