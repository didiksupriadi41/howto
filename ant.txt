Apache Ant is a Java library and command-line tool whose mission is to drive
processes described in build files as targets and extension points dependent
upon each other.

Apache Ant is probably second most used Java build tool right after Apache
Maven. The main difference between these two tools is that Ant is procedural and
Maven is declarative. When using Ant, it is neccessary to exactly describe the
processes which lead to the result. It means that one needs to specify where the
source files are, what needs to be done and when it needs to be done. On the
other hand, Maven relies on conventions and doesn't require specifying most
of the process unless you need to override the defaults.


If upstream ships a Maven POM file, it must be installed even if you
don't build with Maven. If not you should try to search Maven Central
Repository for it, ship it as another source and install it.

.Common spec file
[source,spec]
-------------
BuildRequires: ant
BuildRequires: maven-local
...
%build
ant test

%install
%mvn_artifact pom.xml lib/%{name}.jar

%mvn_install -J api/

%files -f .mfiles
%dir %{_javadir}/%{name}

%files javadoc -f .mfiles-javadoc
------

Details:

    - `%build` section uses `ant` command to build the project and run the
      tests. The used target(s) may vary depending on the `build.xml`
      file. You can use `ant -p` command to list the project info or
      manually look for `<target>` nodes in the `build.xml` file
    - `%mvn_artifact` macro is used to request installation of an
      artifact that was not built using Maven. It expects a POM file and
      a JAR file. For POM only artifacts, the JAR part is omitted. +
      See <<mvn_artifact,Installing additional artifacts>> for more
      information
    - `%mvn_install` performs the actual installation. Optional `-J`
      parameter requests installation of generated Javadoc from given
      directory
    - This method of artifact installation allows using other XMvn
      macros such as `%mvn_alias` or `%mvn_package`
    - `%mvn_install` generates `.mfiles` file which should be used to
      populate `%files` section with `-f` switch. For each subpackage
      there would be separate generated file named
      `.mfiles-subpackage-name`
    - All packages are required to own directories which they create
      (and which are not owned by other packages). JAR files are by
      default installed into subdirectory of `%{_javadir}`. To override
      this behavior, use `%mvn_file`


=== Apache Ivy

Apache Ivy provides an automatic dependency management for Ant managed
builds. It uses Maven repositories for retrieving artifacts and supports
many declarative features of Maven such as handling transitive
dependencies.

XMvn supports local resolution of Ivy artifacts, their installation
and requires generation.


.Spec file
[source, spec]
--------------
BuildRequires: ivy-local
...
%build
ant -Divy.mode=local test

%install
%mvn_artifact ivy.xml lib/sample.jar

%mvn_install -J api/

%files -f .mfiles
%files -javadoc -f .mfiles-javadoc
--------

Details:

    - `-Divy.mode=local` tells Ivy to use XMvn local artifact
      resolution instead of downloading from the Internet
    - If there is an `ivy-settings.xml` or similar file, which specifies
      remote repositories, it needs to be disabled, otherwise it would
      override local resolution.
    - `%mvn_artifact` supports installing artifacts described by Ivy
      configuration files
