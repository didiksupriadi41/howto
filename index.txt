== Abstract
This document aims to help developers create and maintain Java packages in
Fedora. It *does not* supersede or replace
link:https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Packaging:Java[Java Packaging Guidelines],
but rather aims to document tools and techniques used for packaging Java
software on Fedora.

Packaging Java has certain specifics that will be covered in this section which

How to determine preferred upstream build system

[[helper_macros]]
=== Java helper functions

== Build systems

Lorem ipsum about build systems, differences, preferences etcetera.


Will probably include some information about <<Xdepmap,depmap>> files.

=== Ant

Medium length-section about Ant

=== Gradle

No information for Gradle!

== History

This section will be updated with history of Java packaging so that packagers
can get bigger context. We can mention JPP, add_to_maven_depmap madness, Maven
updates between major versions etcetera.

'specialsection' titles.
