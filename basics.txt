This section includes basic introduction to Java packaging world to people
coming from different backgrounds. Goal is to understand language of all groups
involved. If you are a Java developer coming into contact with RPM packaging for
the first time start reading xref:Xbasic_devs[Java developer] section. On the
other hand if you are coming from RPM packaging background an
xref:Xbasic_packagers[introduction to Java world] is probably better starting point.
