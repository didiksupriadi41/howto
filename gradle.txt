[quote,,from Gradle package description]
______
Gradle combines the power and flexibility of Ant with the dependency
management and conventions of Maven into a more effective way to
build.  Powered by a Groovy DSL and packed with innovation, Gradle
provides a declarative way to describe all kinds of builds through
sensible defaults.  Gradle is quickly becoming the build system of
choice for many open source projects, leading edge enterprises and
legacy automation challenges.

Gradle is quickly gaining popularity as flexible Java build system,
which can be used in situations requiring writing custom build logic.
Flexibility means that Gradle build scripts can differ significantly
across different projects and there is no universal way of packaging
Gradle projects.  However, in most common situations the following
steps can are necessary:

1. Add build-dependency on `gradle-local`
2. In `%build` section of the spec file call `gradle-local` script
   with `--offline` switch and appropriate build targets as arguments
3. Mark generated artifacts using `%mvn_artifact` macro
4. In `%install` section, use `%mvn_install` macro with `-J` argument
   pointing to directory containing generated Javadoc documentation
5. Use generated file `.mfiles` lists to populate `%files` section
   with `-f` switch

.Common spec file sections

gradle-local -s --offline ...
%mvn_artifact ...

%install

%files -f .mfiles

%files javadoc -f .mfiles-javadoc
-------


`gradle-local` is a wrapper script for `gradle` command which enables
so called "local mode" of artifact resolution - artifacts are first
resolved from local system before trying remote repositories (system
Maven repositories are used through XMvn).

In most simple cases calling `gradle-local` should be enough to
resolve all dependencies, but sometimes additional patching of build
script may be necessary.  The following example patch adds XMvn
resolver to make Gradle correctly resolve dependencies of build script
itself.

-------


Once Gradle build completes, all relevant artifacts must be marked
using `%mvn_artifact` macro for later installation.  `%mvn_install`
automatically handles installation of all marked artifacts and
generates of `.mfiles` file lists, which are used to define package
contents through `%file` sections.
